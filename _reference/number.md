## Details

A number is a sequence of digits, 0-9.

Numbers are used to identify program statements, and are used in numeric expressions.

Numbers are integers.  They cannot include decimal points or fractions.

The valid range for numbers depends upon the hardware on which BitsyBASIC is running.  On a device with a 32-bit processor, the valid range is approximately -2,000,000,000 to +2,000,000,000.  On a machine with a 64-bit processor, the valid range is approximately -4,000,000,000,000,000,000 to +4,000,000,000,000,000,000.


## Examples

    PRINT 12345678
